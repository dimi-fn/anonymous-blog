# Description

This project is about constructing a platform where users can submit a post anonymously
* When a user hits 'publish', the post is then stored in the database and displayed on the frontend. 
* The user can create another post by removing the hash extension from the url which defined the show route
* **To do**: The user is able to access their post using the show route which is in the form of `url#posts/<id>`
